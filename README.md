# Aus_City_Data_Analysis
This is a series of python programs which utilise the pandas library to sort and print out Australian cities by certain attributes, and then to rank the cities in each state by the same Attribute.
The Max_pops.py program sorts the cities based on population.
The Max_latitude.py program sorts the cities based on the most northern latitude.
